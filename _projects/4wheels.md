[This](https://github.com/boring180/four_wheels) is a control code for a 4-wheeled robot. The code is written in C++ for ESP32. It is made for a practice on robot controls. It is currently written in C++ and PlatformIO. The code is still under development, and more features will be added later. 

The first application of the code is to control an omni drive robot - notei. It is made as a note(FRC2024 game piece) shaped robot to simulate a running node.
