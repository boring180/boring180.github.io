This is the first year since I joined CPEG(Computer Engineering Program of HKUST), and approximately two years since my first "Hello World" program. I have been through a lot of things in 2024, and I would like to share some of them with you.

In the end of 2023, I had a review of my academic life, and I found that I was no longer interested in design and the stress of ISD had ruined my university life. I decided to change my major to something more technical, and I'm currently studying in the Computer Engineering Program of HKUST.

I have taken a lot of COMP courses in 2024, and I have released my notes of COMP2011, COMP2012, COMP2611, COMP3711, and COMP 5212. The notes are available on my [resource page](https://boring180.github.io/Resources/).

There are various fields in CPEG, and I choose AI and Robotics as my main focus. I will take more courses in these two fields in the future, and hopefully I can contribute to the field of AI and Robotics in the future.

To introduce myself in a more detailed way, I made this website in late 2024. I hope you can know more about me through this website, and I will keep updating it in the future.
